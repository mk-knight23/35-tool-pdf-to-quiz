This is a sample document about artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts in AI include:
- Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by biological neural networks
- Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning using multi-layered neural networks  
- Natural Language Processing: AI that helps computers understand human language
- Computer Vision: AI that enables computers to interpret and analyze visual information

Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type serves different purposes in solving real-world problems.

The history of AI dates back to the 1950s when computer scientists began exploring the possibility of creating thinking machines. Today, AI powers many applications we use daily, from voice assistants to recommendation systems.
